# OpenShift on IBM Cloud Workshops

[Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-why_openshift) is an extension of the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, where IBM manages OpenShift Container Platform for you. 

With Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud developers have a fast and secure way to containerize and deploy enterprise workloads in Kubernetes clusters. OpenShift clusters build on Kubernetes container orchestration that offers consistency and flexibility for your development lifecycle operations.

This repository holds a series of workshops that help you as a developer to become familiar with Red Hat OpenShift, how it can be deployed on the IBM Cloud, and how to deploy applications on and with OpenShift.

In order to run these workshops, you need an [IBM Cloud account](https://ibm.biz/BdzAjk).

## Workshop 1: Understanding OpenShift

In this workshop we will show you how to create your own OpenShift cluster on the IBM Cloud, how to use the `oc` CLI (command line interface) and how to use the OpenShift Web Console to deploy applications.

* Duration: 60 - 90 minutes
* Audience: Beginner
